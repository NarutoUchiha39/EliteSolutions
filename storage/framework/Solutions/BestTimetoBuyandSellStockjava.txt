/*
In this question we need to find the maximum profit we can earn by selling stocks. If we encounter a situation such that the cost of left profit minus the cost of right profit is less than zero, it means that we are havig a profit by selling stocks at that day. So we take the max of earning profit by selling stocks at that day and the current stocks. In case the profit is +ve it means that cost at second day > cost at first day hence we are at a loss. As a result move the left pointer ahead to the next nunmber

    public int maxProfit(int[] prices)

        int total_cost = 0;

        int right = 0;
        while(right &lt prices.length)
        {
            if(prices[left]-prices[right] &lt= 0){
                total_cost = Math.max(total_cost,prices[right]-prices[left]);
                right+=1;
            }

            else{
                left+=1;
