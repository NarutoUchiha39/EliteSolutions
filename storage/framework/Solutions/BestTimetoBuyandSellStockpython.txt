"""
In this question we need to find the maximum profit we can earn by selling stocks. If we encounter a situation such that the cost of left profit minus the cost of right profit is less than zero, it means that we are havig a profit by selling stocks at that day. So we take the max of earning profit by selling stocks at that day and the current stocks. In case the profit is +ve it means that cost at second day > cost at first day hence we are at a loss. As a result move the left pointer ahead to the next nunmber
